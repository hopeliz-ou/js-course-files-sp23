<!--
    This should pop up a prompt for my name and greeting when I load the page like in issue one, 
    but I want to send the person's name into the function to use there. 
    The prompt shows up, but it's not in the greeting. 
    How do I get it to pop up my greeting using the function? (fix and submit).
